I made this tool to easily extract the graphics from the game "Yu Yu Hakusho - Bakutou Ankoku Bujutsukai (J).nes", the graphics are in the chr ram, and they use an RLE compression algorithm. Use yychr or any graphic editor for edit, then compress again.

## Usage

Synopsis:
```
 [-d | -c]  -- decompress  --compress
```
If you need edit the texts use: https://github.com/KodingBTW/yuyuhakushobabnes-translationtool

### Can I use this tool in my personal project?

Of course, there's no need to ask. Feel free to use it in your project. I only ask that you mention me as contributor.
